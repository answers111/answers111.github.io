Hi, I'm Zhaojian Yu, currently a first-year M.S. student at [SIGS](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), Tsinghua University, advised by Prof. [Xiao-Ping Zhang](https://www.tbsi.edu.cn/zxp_en/main.htm). Before that, I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Jinan University in Jun. 2023. My currect research interest lies in LLMs, and its application in various areas.
