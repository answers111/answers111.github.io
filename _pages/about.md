Hi, I'm Zhaojian Yu, currently a second-year M.S. student at [SIGS](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), Tsinghua University, advised by Prof. [Xiao-Ping Zhang](https://www.tbsi.edu.cn/zxp_en/main.htm). Before that, I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Jinan University in Jun. 2023. My currect research interest lies in LLMs, and its application in various areas. My email is yzj23@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn.

- [Arxiv 2024] [*HumanEval Pro and MBPP Pro: Evaluating Large Language Models on Self-invoking Code Generation*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21199) 
<br> **Zhaojian Yu**, Yilun Zhao, Arman Cohan, Xiao-Ping Zhang
<br> We present HumanEval Pro and MBPP Pro, two expanded versions of the traditional HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks to evaluate LLMs on self-invoking code generation task. Self-invoking code generation, a new task designed to evaluate the progressive reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of LLMs. In this task, models are presented with a base problem and a related, more complex problem. They must solve the base problem and then utilize its solution to address the more complex one.

- [Arxiv 2024] [*OpenCarbonEval: A Unified Carbon Emission Estimation Framework in Large-Scale AI Models*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12843) 
<br> **Zhaojian Yu**\*, Yinghao Wu\*, Zhuotao Deng, Yansong Tang, Xiao-Ping Zhang
<br> OpenCarbonEval is a unified framework for integrating large-scale models across diverse modalities to predict carbon emissions, which could provide AI service providers and users with a means to estimate emissions beforehand and help mitigate the environmental pressure associated with these models.
